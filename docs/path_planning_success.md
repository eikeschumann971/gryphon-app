Summary
I've successfully analyzed your project and created a complete example application demonstrating the path planning domain with three separate processes:

✅ Created Three Binary Processes:
1. Path Planning Planner (cargo run --bin pathplan_planner)
Purpose: Central coordination service managing PathPlanner aggregates
Features:
Creates and manages PathPlanner instances with A* algorithm
Processes path planning requests from clients
Manages worker registrations and assignments
Maintains aggregate state using event sourcing
Provides status reports every 30 seconds
2. Path Planning Client (cargo run --bin pathplan_client)
Purpose: Simulates real-world clients making path planning requests
Features:
5 predefined realistic scenarios (office, warehouse, hospital, security, kitchen)
Random request generation with position variations
Detailed logging of requests and simulated responses
Multiple operation modes (demo → random → continuous)
Realistic agent types and mission scenarios
3. A Path Planning Worker* (cargo run --bin pathplan_worker)
Purpose: Implements A* algorithm and processes assignments ⭐ Updated/Enhanced
Features:
Worker registration with planner service
A* algorithm capability advertisement
Work assignment acceptance and processing
Realistic A* pathfinding with waypoint generation
Completion/failure reporting back to planner
Proper communication protocols
🏗️ Architecture Highlights:
Domain-Driven Design: Clear separation between domain logic and infrastructure
Event Sourcing: All state changes captured as immutable domain events
CQRS: Separate command/query responsibilities
Microservices: Independent, communicating processes
Worker Pool Management: Dynamic registration and assignment
Algorithm Abstraction: Support for multiple planning algorithms
🎯 Key Domain Events Demonstrated:
PlannerCreated: Planner initialization
PathPlanRequested: New path planning request (renamed from RouteRequested)
WorkerRegistered: Worker joins the system
WorkerReady: Worker available for assignments
PlanAssigned: Work assigned to worker
PlanCompleted: Successful path generation
PlanFailed: Path planning failure

🚀 How to Run:
Terminal 1: cargo run --bin pathplan_planner (starts coordination service)
Terminal 2: cargo run --bin pathplan_worker (starts A* worker)
Terminal 3: cargo run --bin pathplan_client (starts sending requests)
📚 Learning Value:
This example demonstrates a complete DDD/Event Sourcing/CQRS implementation in Rust, showing how to structure microservices for robotics and autonomous systems. It's a practical implementation of the path planning domain that you can run and observe in action.

The existing bin/pathplan_worker was thoroughly updated to integrate properly with the domain model, while maintaining the A* algorithm implementation you already had.
