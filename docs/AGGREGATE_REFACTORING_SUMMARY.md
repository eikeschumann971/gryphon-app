# Path Planning Aggregate Refactoring

## Overview
Successfully refactored the large `aggregate.rs` file (533 lines) into a well-organized module structure with 6 focused files in the `src/domains/path_planning/aggregate/` subfolder.

## New Module Structure

```
src/domains/path_planning/aggregate/
├── mod.rs              # Module exports and re-exports
├── types.rs            # Core data types (Position2D, Orientation2D, RouteRequest, PlanningAlgorithm)
├── worker.rs           # Worker-related structures (PathPlanWorker, WorkerStatus, PlanAssignment)
├── plan.rs             # Plan structures (PathPlan, PlanStatus)
├── workspace.rs        # Workspace structures (Workspace, WorkspaceBounds, Obstacle)
└── path_planner.rs     # Main PathPlanner aggregate with business logic (300+ lines)
```

## File Breakdown

### types.rs (29 lines)
- `Position2D` - 2D coordinate structure
- `Orientation2D` - Angle representation
- `RouteRequest` - Request for path planning
- `PlanningAlgorithm` - Available algorithms enum

### worker.rs (24 lines)
- `PathPlanWorker` - Worker entity with capabilities and status
- `WorkerStatus` - Worker lifecycle states (Idle, Busy, Offline)
- `PlanAssignment` - Work assignment tracking with timeouts

### plan.rs (22 lines)
- `PathPlan` - Core plan structure with orientations and timestamps
- `PlanStatus` - Plan lifecycle states (Planning, Assigned, InProgress, Complete, Failed, Executing)

### workspace.rs (25 lines)
- `Workspace` - Environment definition with bounds and obstacles
- `WorkspaceBounds` - Coordinate boundaries
- `Obstacle` - Obstacle definitions with various shapes

### path_planner.rs (365 lines)
- `PathPlanner` - Main aggregate with all business logic
- Command handlers for route requests and worker management
- Event sourcing implementation with apply() method
- Private helper methods for work assignment

### mod.rs (11 lines)
- Module declarations and public re-exports
- Maintains clean public API - all types available at aggregate level

## Benefits Achieved

### 🎯 **Single Responsibility**
Each file has a clear, focused purpose:
- Types: Basic data structures
- Worker: Worker coordination logic
- Plan: Plan lifecycle management
- Workspace: Environment modeling
- PathPlanner: Business orchestration

### 📦 **Improved Maintainability**
- Easier to locate specific functionality
- Reduced cognitive load when working on specific aspects
- Clear separation of concerns

### 🔄 **Better Dependencies**
- Resolved circular dependency issues between events and aggregate
- Clean import structure with types flowing bottom-up

### 📝 **Enhanced Readability**
- 6 focused files instead of 1 large file
- Each file under 365 lines (most under 30 lines)
- Clear module organization

### 🧪 **Zero Breaking Changes**
- All existing tests pass (4/4 path planner tests)
- Public API unchanged - re-exports maintain compatibility
- No changes needed in consuming code

## Technical Details

### Import Structure
```rust
// Clean dependency flow
events.rs -> aggregate/types.rs
aggregate/worker.rs -> aggregate/types.rs
aggregate/plan.rs -> aggregate/types.rs  
aggregate/workspace.rs -> aggregate/types.rs
aggregate/path_planner.rs -> all aggregate modules + events.rs
```

### Public API Preservation
```rust
// mod.rs maintains clean re-exports
pub use types::*;
pub use worker::*;
pub use plan::*;
pub use workspace::*;
pub use path_planner::PathPlanner;
```

## Verification
✅ **Build Success**: All compilation warnings resolved  
✅ **Test Coverage**: 4/4 path planner tests passing  
✅ **API Compatibility**: No breaking changes to existing code  
✅ **Module Organization**: Clear separation of concerns achieved  

## Next Steps
The refactored structure provides an excellent foundation for:
- Adding new worker algorithms (extend types.rs)
- Implementing advanced workspace features (extend workspace.rs)
- Enhanced plan lifecycle management (extend plan.rs)
- Additional worker coordination patterns (extend worker.rs)

This refactoring significantly improves code organization while maintaining full backward compatibility and test coverage.
